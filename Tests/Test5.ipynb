        "\n",
        "*   Descriptive statistics analyze the entire dataset without looking beyond it.\n",

        "*   Descriptive statistics deal with the data as it is, providing insights about its distribution and measures.\n",
        "*   Inferential statistics test hypotheses, make predictions, or estimate population parameters.\n",
